pub const TASK_INSTRUCTION: &str = "\nTask execution: use run_tools to start independent tools concurrently. Every call must include a concise, human-readable title in the user's language, describing the action and its target (for example, 检查 RDP 会话状态 or 运行项目测试 for Chinese conversations). Titles appear in the execution workflow; never use only a tool name or a raw shell command. Its response may contain pending task IDs. Use wait_tools to receive results (timeouts only end the wait). Use get_tasks with specific task_ids when progress or output is needed; an empty query is only a bounded overview of tasks needing attention. Do not reread completed history unless it is relevant to the user's request. Never claim a pending task succeeded. Before finishing, receive required results and detach or cancel remaining attached tasks. Preserve already detached work; do not cancel a background session needed for user confirmation just to clean up. command runs noninteractive CLI programs. Do not repeatedly poll without waiting. Parent task IDs denote actual subtasks, not mere dependencies.\n";
